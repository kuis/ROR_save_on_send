## APP ARCHITECTURE

Models diagram is located in: doc/models.svg
Controllers diagram is located in: doc/controllers.svg

Web framework that we're using(Ruby on Rails) relies on the MVC pattern. 
Model-View-Controller has some benefits over traditional concepts:

* it keeps your business logic separated from your (HTML-based) views
* keeps your code clean and neat in one place

another approach that is the key feature of Rails is a Representational state transfer (REST)
